Points Earned 100/100
Database Integration and Data Migration (60 points)

Database Setup (20 points):

MongoDB connection setup can be found in the main server file (e.g., app.js).
Data Model Schema Design (10 points):

Schema designs, including Song model, are located in respective model files (e.g., songModel.js).
Data Migration (10 points):

Data migration code can be found in the routes where existing data is retrieved from the previous structure and stored in the new database.
Frontend and Backend Data Sync (20 points):

The synchronization of frontend displays with backend data is managed in the EJS files, especially those rendering dynamic content (e.g., producer1.ejs).
Dynamic UI Components (20 points)

Dynamic Creation of UI Components (10 points):

Dynamic UI component creation is handled in the EJS files where database content is fetched and used to generate dynamic elements (e.g., common_page.ejs).
Contextual Use of Static Displays (10 points):

Static UI components are appropriately placed in the EJS files, ensuring they are used only when options are not expected to change dynamically (e.g., producer1.ejs).
Session Management and Continuity (20 points)

Data Persistence and Restoration (10 points):

Code ensuring session data persistence and restoration across page reloads is implemented in the server file, where routes handle user interactions and render pages (e.g., app.js).
Logout and Session Clearing (10 points):

The logout mechanism, including session clearing, is implemented in the server file, where the route for user logout is defined (e.g., app.js).
This self-evaluation provides a roadmap to where the relevant code for each point can be found in your project without directly referencing specific code excerpts.
